Project Components:

Anomaly Detection in Sales Data:

Identify unusual sales patterns across stores and departments.
Investigate potential causes (e.g., holidays, markdowns, economic indicators).
Implement anomaly handling strategies to clean the data for further analysis.

Time-Based Anomaly Detection:

Analyze sales trends over time.
Detect seasonal variations and holiday effects on sales.
Use time-series analysis for understanding store and department performance over time.

Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:

Handle missing values, especially in the MarkDown data.
Create new features that could influence sales (e.g., store size/type, regional factors).

Customer Segmentation Analysis:

Segment stores or departments based on sales patterns, markdowns, and regional features.
Analyze segment-specific trends and characteristics.

Market Basket Analysis:

Although individual customer transaction data is not available, infer potential product associations within departments using sales data.
Develop cross-selling strategies based on these inferences.

Demand Forecasting:

Build models to forecast weekly sales for each store and department.
Incorporate factors like CPI, unemployment rate, fuel prices, and store/dept attributes.
Explore short-term and long-term forecasting models.

Impact of External Factors:

Examine how external factors (economic indicators, regional climate) influence sales.
Incorporate these insights into the demand forecasting models.

Personalization Strategies:

Develop personalized marketing strategies based on the markdowns and store segments.
Propose inventory management strategies tailored to store and department needs.

Segmentation Quality Evaluation:

Evaluate the effectiveness of the customer segmentation.
Use metrics to assess the quality of segments in terms of homogeneity and separation.

Real-World Application and Strategy Formulation:

Formulate a comprehensive strategy for inventory management, marketing, and store optimization based on the insights gathered.
Discuss potential real-world challenges in implementing these strategies.
